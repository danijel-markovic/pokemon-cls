## Technologies Used
- **Pandas**: Employed for data loading and manipulation.
- **Plotly**: Utilized for interactive data visualization.
- **Pandas Profiling**: Adopted for an automated and efficient exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **PyCaret**: A low-code machine learning library facilitating our modeling process.

## Setup and Installation
This project utilizes a DevContainer for an isolated and consistent development environment. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension enabled.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/legendary-pokemon-classifier.git

```
## Data Exploration and Analysis

We commence our adventure with an exploratory analysis to familiarize ourselves with the dataset's characteristics and potential features contributing to a Pokémon's legendary status.

## Modeling

Utilizing PyCaret, we streamline the modeling process, experimenting with various algorithms to unearth the most promising model for our classification task.

## Visualizations

With the aid of Plotly, we craft interactive visualizations to interpret our findings and the underlying patterns within the data.
